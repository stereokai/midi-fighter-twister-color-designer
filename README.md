### What is this?

This is a fun tool for designing color layouts for MIDI Fighter Twister.

Just connect your MFT, and twist the knobs!

Once you are done creating your pretty color scheme, press the "copy colors" button. This will copy a MIDI command (aka message), that you can use to configure MFT to display your color scheme on-demand with your favorite MIDI software, for example, [ReaLearn](https://www.helgoboss.org/projects/realearn/ "By Helgoboss").

All useful knob types are supported: MIDI CC, MIDI note, and relative (ENC 3FH/41H). In addition, all sensitivities are supported: responsive, high resolution and velocity mode.

This tool uses Web MIDI and as of 2021 works on Chrome, Edge and Opera.
