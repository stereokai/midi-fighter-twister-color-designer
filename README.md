### What is this?

This is a fun tool for designing color layouts for MIDI Fighter Twister.

Just connect your MFT, and twist the knobs!

Once you are done creating your pretty color scheme, press the "copy colors" button. This will copy a MIDI command (aka message), that you can use to configure MFT to display your color scheme on-demand with your favorite MIDI software, for example, [ReaLearn](https://www.helgoboss.org/projects/realearn/ "By Helgoboss").

This tool uses Web MIDI and as of 2021 works on Chrome, Edge and Opera.
